# Group Project - Mining for Py


## Project Overview
The goal for this project is to analyze the price changes in graphics cards over the last three years in comparison to price changes in cryptocurrencies.  The expectation is that there is a direct correlation in the price fluctuations between the hardware and cryptocurrencies.  Stock price changes for the companies that manufacture the hardware will also be compared to cryptocurrency price changes.


## Team Members

## Questions to Answer
* What is the correlation between GPU price change (%) and the change in cryptocurrency prices over the last three years? 
* What is the correlation between crypto prices and stock prices for companies that manufacture GPUs over the last three years?


## Data Sources
* Amazon for hardware pricing - top GPU and RAM models:  
Graphics cards:  N_1080ti, N_1080, N_1070ti, N_1070, N_1060ti, N_1060, N_1050ti, N_1050, AMD_RX50, AMD_Vega_56

* Nasdaq for stock prices - AMD (AMD), Invidia (NVDA), and Micron (MU)
* Crypto Compare API for cryto prices - Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP), Ethereum(ETH), Litecoin (LTC), EOS (EOS), and Dash (Dash)


## Data Limitations
